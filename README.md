# RiskDice
## Simple browser game for 2 people.

Game consists of 2 players, each with their own "current score" and their "total score".

The goal of the game is to reach a total score of 100.

Each player gets to roll 2 die and they can either choose to "hold" or to roll again.

* When a player rolls the dice, the numbers on the dice get added together and gets added to their "current score".
* By "holding", the player adds the current score to their total score, and gives the turn to the other player.
* By choosing to roll again, the new roll is added to the player's current score, and they may be able to "hold" a greater value.
* **However, if either of the dice rolls a 1 at any time, the current score of the player is reset to 0 and the turn is given to the other player.**

* Each player can choose to play the game safely and hold more frequently, or they can take some risk and choose to increase their current score faster without giving the other player many turns.
